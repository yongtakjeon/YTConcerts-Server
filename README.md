# YT Concerts

YT concerts provides concert information in Canada using 'Ticketmaster' API.

There are many sites that provide concert information in Canada, but it was difficult to find a site that provides price information of several performances at once. (The price information of the concert could only be checked by going to the page showing the detailed information of the concert.) YT concerts compensated for that problem.
